# **Fraud Detection App** üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This repository contains a machine learning web application for detecting fraudulent financial transactions. The app provides a simple interface where users can input transaction details, and the trained model will predict whether the transaction is likely to be fraudulent.

The goal of this project is to showcase an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from model training and saving to deployment as a web application.

## **Project Structure**

  * `fraud_detection.py`: The main Streamlit application file.
  * `fraud_detection_pipelin.pkl`: The pre-trained machine learning model, saved as a pickle file.
  * `requirements.txt`: A list of all the Python libraries required to run the app.

-----

## **Technologies Used**

  * **Python**: The core programming language.
  * **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application.
  * **scikit-learn**: For training the machine learning model.
  * **Pandas**: For data manipulation and processing.
  * **Joblib**: For saving and loading the pre-trained model.

## **How to Run Locally**

To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/akanshalakhina/Fraud-Detection-App.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd Fraud-Detection-App
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Streamlit app**:

    ```bash
    streamlit run fraud_detection.py
    ```

    The app will automatically open in your web browser.
